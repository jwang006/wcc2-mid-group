    <P>This project is an online interactive <a href="https://jwang006.github.io/poetry-to-mood/"> poetry library </a>that aims to convey the mood of ancient Chinese poetry across linguistic boundaries.
      The character of each word represents a specific meaning or an abstract meaning.  
      Likewise, words from different civilisations have poems that carry history and emotions.
      We from China are using Chinese, which is one of the important characters in this world. 
      We want to use Chinese poems to express what the ancient artists brought to us.
